# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Form Filling Web Application

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize a new project directory
- [ ] Set up version control (Git)
- [ ] Create a virtual environment for Python

## 2. Backend Development (FastAPI)
- [ ] Install FastAPI and dependencies
- [ ] Set up basic FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
  - [ ] Receiving form data
  - [ ] Handling PDF uploads
  - [ ] Processing PDFs and interacting with Anthropic API
- [ ] Implement PDF to image conversion
- [ ] Integrate Anthropic SDK for AI processing
- [ ] Implement JSON response parsing and structuring

## 3. Frontend Development (Vite + React)
- [ ] Set up Vite project with React template
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (react-hook-form, axios, etc.)
- [ ] Create basic application structure
- [ ] Implement form using react-hook-form
- [ ] Create PDF upload component
- [ ] Implement API calls to backend

## 4. AI Form Filler Feature
- [ ] Develop backend logic for PDF processing
- [ ] Implement Anthropic API integration with tool use for JSON extraction
- [ ] Create frontend UI for AI form filling feature
- [ ] Implement logic to populate form with AI-generated data

## 5. Integration and Testing
- [ ] Connect frontend and backend
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of all features
- [ ] Optimize performance and user experience

## 6. Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Write documentation for setup and usage
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (containerization if necessary)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Final Review and Launch
- [ ] Conduct final review of all features
- [ ] Address any remaining issues or improvements
- [ ] Launch the application

## Technologies and Tools
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Anthropic SDK
- Frontend: JavaScript, React, Vite, react-hook-form
- PDF Processing: (TBD - e.g., PyMuPDF, pdf2image)
- API Communication: Axios
- Version Control: Git
- Deployment: (TBD based on hosting choice)

## Next Steps
1. Set up the project structure
2. Begin with backend development, focusing on PDF processing and Anthropic API integration
3. Proceed with frontend development, implementing the form and file upload functionality
4. Integrate the AI form filling feature
5. Conduct thorough testing and refinement
