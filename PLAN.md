# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Form Filling Web Application

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application that leverages AI technology to assist users in filling out forms. The application consists of a FastAPI Python backend and a Vite + React frontend, providing a seamless and intelligent form-filling experience.

### Key Features:
1. User-friendly web interface with a customizable form
2. PDF document upload functionality
3. AI-powered form filling based on uploaded PDF content
4. Integration with Anthropic's AI API for intelligent data extraction

### How it Works:
1. Users access the web application and are presented with a form created using react-hook-form.
2. Users can upload a PDF document containing relevant information.
3. The backend processes the PDF, converting it to images.
4. These images are sent to the Anthropic API, which uses advanced AI to extract structured data.
5. The extracted data is returned as JSON, formatted to match the form fields.
6. The frontend automatically populates the form with the extracted data.
7. Users can review, edit, and submit the pre-filled form.

This innovative approach combines the power of AI with a user-friendly interface, streamlining the often tedious process of form filling and reducing errors in data entry.

## Project Structure

## Technologies and Tools
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Anthropic SDK
- Frontend: JavaScript, React, Vite, react-hook-form
- PDF Processing: pdf2image
- API Communication: Axios
- Version Control: Git
- Deployment: (TBD based on hosting choice)

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
   - Add try-catch blocks in critical areas of the backend
   - Implement input validation on the frontend
   - Create meaningful error messages for users
2. Perform thorough testing
   - Write unit tests for backend functions
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints
   - Implement end-to-end tests for the entire application flow
3. Optimize performance
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize image processing and API calls
   - Implement caching where appropriate
4. Enhance user experience
   - Add loading indicators for long-running processes
   - Implement form field validation with real-time feedback
   - Create a more intuitive UI for PDF upload and form filling
5. Improve documentation
   - Write clear setup instructions for both frontend and backend
   - Document API endpoints and their usage
   - Create user guides for the application
6. Prepare for deployment
   - Set up containerization (e.g., Docker) if needed
   - Configure environment variables for production
   - Plan for scalability and potential cloud deployment
