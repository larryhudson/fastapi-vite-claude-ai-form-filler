# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Form Filling Web Application

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application that leverages AI technology to assist users in filling out forms. The application will consist of a FastAPI Python backend and a Vite + React frontend, providing a seamless and intelligent form-filling experience.

### Key Features:
1. User-friendly web interface with a customizable form
2. PDF document upload functionality
3. AI-powered form filling based on uploaded PDF content
4. Integration with Anthropic's AI API for intelligent data extraction

### How it Works:
1. Users access the web application and are presented with a form created using react-hook-form.
2. Users can upload a PDF document containing relevant information.
3. The backend processes the PDF, converting it to images.
4. These images are sent to the Anthropic API, which uses advanced AI to extract structured data.
5. The extracted data is returned as JSON, formatted to match the form fields.
6. The frontend automatically populates the form with the extracted data.
7. Users can review, edit, and submit the pre-filled form.

This innovative approach combines the power of AI with a user-friendly interface, streamlining the often tedious process of form filling and reducing errors in data entry.

## Project Structure

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize a new project directory
- [ ] Set up version control (Git)
- [ ] Create a virtual environment for Python

## 2. Backend Development (FastAPI)
- [ ] Install FastAPI and dependencies
- [ ] Set up basic FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
  - [ ] Receiving form data
  - [ ] Handling PDF uploads
  - [ ] Processing PDFs and interacting with Anthropic API
- [ ] Implement PDF to image conversion
- [ ] Integrate Anthropic SDK for AI processing
- [ ] Implement JSON response parsing and structuring

## 3. Frontend Development (Vite + React)
- [ ] Set up Vite project with React template
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (react-hook-form, axios, etc.)
- [ ] Create basic application structure
- [ ] Implement form using react-hook-form
- [ ] Create PDF upload component
- [ ] Implement API calls to backend

## 4. AI Form Filler Feature
- [ ] Develop backend logic for PDF processing
- [ ] Implement Anthropic API integration with tool use for JSON extraction
- [ ] Create frontend UI for AI form filling feature
- [ ] Implement logic to populate form with AI-generated data

## 5. Integration and Testing
- [ ] Connect frontend and backend
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of all features
- [ ] Optimize performance and user experience

## 6. Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Write documentation for setup and usage
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (containerization if necessary)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Final Review and Launch
- [ ] Conduct final review of all features
- [ ] Address any remaining issues or improvements
- [ ] Launch the application

## Technologies and Tools
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Anthropic SDK
- Frontend: JavaScript, React, Vite, react-hook-form
- PDF Processing: (TBD - e.g., PyMuPDF, pdf2image)
- API Communication: Axios
- Version Control: Git
- Deployment: (TBD based on hosting choice)

## Next Steps
1. Set up the project structure
2. Begin with backend development, focusing on PDF processing and Anthropic API integration
3. Proceed with frontend development, implementing the form and file upload functionality
4. Integrate the AI form filling feature
5. Conduct thorough testing and refinement
